Description: quilt for git; similar to Mercurial queues
 Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
 queues-like functionality and interface to git.  The one distinguishing
 feature from other quilt-like porcelains, is the format of the patches
 directory. 
 .
 All the information is stored as plain text - a series file and the 
 patches (one per file). This easily lends itself to versioning the patches
 using any number of SCMs.
